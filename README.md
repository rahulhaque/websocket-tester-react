## More Info

This is a basic approach towards making a websocket tester app which can be used to test the logic of any websocket. Often we need to implement a websocket server for ourselves. However, testing process of the inner logic of the websocket quickly becomes tiresome. This app aims to lessen that effort.

Spare a ⭐ to keep me motivated. 😃
